              <span
                >Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic,
                and just has not been tried in the market. Once one initial
                company opens up this model, many more will follow and copy:

                For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter
                can be built in Bangladesh for a family in need. This gives rise
                to the idea that anytime someone walks into a designer store and
                purchased an item, they are having to burn down a house (most
                making this decision unknowingly).
              </span>
              <span>
                Based on the principle “if a penny saved is a penny earned” we
                can extrapolate that to a Louie bag is a home burned. But just
                telling someone not to flex is not going to solve the problem.
                If we really want to win this war, we just need to sell higher
                status, for the same price.
              </span>
              <span>
                Imagine trying to connect with a luxury purse buyer as
                protestors outside of a designer store. Rather than simply
                protesting their spending on that good, we need to sell them a
                better version of what they are buying.
              </span>
              <span>
                Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set
                up showing customers videos of the harmed animals may not be a
                great way to connect with the target audience, and often cause a
                greater divide in mindsets.
              </span>
              <span>
                In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside of
                luxury goods markets, sporting the aligned luxury merch. Rodeo
                drive for example is a notorious spot where every designer store
                not only has a shop, but theres a steady flow of customers.

                Social media accounts devoted to making content here are already
                massively viral amassing hundreds of millions of views
                interviewing buyers. Each successful conversion, would make for
                a viral video and an ad set, bringing potentially thousands of
                new customers while kickstarting educating the world of the low
                status of wasteful spending now that a better alternative
                exists.

              <h3>Making Altruism Culturally High Status.</h3>
              <span
                >Ultimately, the more projects that promote this new line of
                thinking, the more people think others think this way, the more
                status will align culturally with its true nature. Watching
                others do good for the world has always given us more hope for
                humanity. We believe the flippening of status has the potential
                to solve the worlds greatest cause of poverty, the failed
                distribution of wealth worldwide.
              </span>
              <span>
                We don’t need to enforce rules where people are forced to give
                up their things, we need brands that invest in education for the
                masses to wake up to what real status/value is and place higher
                alternatives into the market.
              </span>

                With the release of more and more globally disruptive
                technology, anxiousness about our focus on making sure things
                goes right becomes more apparent. By educating the world on
                alignment of using money and power for good from the most basic
                layer of apparel we will begin to cause this shift. With the
                right priming, a large amount of legacy wealth will be funneled
                into shifting the global workforce into focusing on the worlds
                greatest problems.
