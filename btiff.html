              <h2>Bringing The Inevitable Future Forward</h2>
              <span
                >There’s a vibe shift underway, as we get closer and closer to a
                post scarcity economy, the eternal currency of the future of
                good karma will become more clear.
              </span>
              <span>
                For the greedy who still wish to hold on to ownership of
                something land is going to skyrocket as an asset, ownership on
                plots of earth will be seen as one of the steadiest investments
                as we approach a hyper decrease in the cost of building.
              </span>
              <span>
                The people who recognize this shift will do well to mortgage
                their house, buying a larger plot of land somewhere.
              </span>
              <span>
                If super-intelligence is democratic, honoring that ownership of
                land will be a decision the world makes. (Clearly the idea that
                those who hoarded their wealth and tried to hold on to value
                should have more value than those who put their wealth to work,
                giving up their assets, is one that will be a hard attempt)
                Propaganda for people to relinquish their assets to funds more
                of the poverty of the world will help the world make this
                decision when the time comes.
              </span>

                While theres no specific data for what defines “Luxury” housing,
                this is of course a far larger asset class which outshines the
                luxury car and luxury goods market.
              </span>
              <span>
                What actually makes one house better than the other (often its
                simply the status it has rather than utility) if it was all
                about utility people would buy the cheaper house and install the
                heated seat toilets, and floors etc. (but then how would people
                respect them more?). What if we were not ranked by the size of
                our house, but instead by the size of our donations.
              </span>
              <span>
                You may remember that app that was $999 called “Im rich” and did
                nothing. That’s what designer clothing represents today. Useless
                expense for materials with patterns that represent pure vanity.
                Pure spending power gone to pure status.
              </span>
              <span>
                It is tasteless…. and we believe society is not only waking up
                to that fact, but it is inevitable that we will create better
                alternatives.
              </span>
              <span>
                In a subjective culture sense we see IN-YOUR-FACE luxury style
                goods declining while a push for understated looks are coming
                forward. Brands such as Gucci are being seen as more
                oversaturated, and pieces that lack design besides the plastery
                of the luxury logo on the piece are seen as tacky.
              </span>
              <span> Evidence of this: </span>
              <span>
                Brands like Gucci are becoming less hip. <br />
                Designer brands that are in your face are not it.
              </span>
              <span> Designer that’s low-key is now the trend. </span>
              <span>
                Designer is dialing back as consumers replace spending to these
                models.
              </span>
              <span>
                We believe the changing of status starting at a clothing level
                will cause one of the largest wealth flow transfers towards good
                for the world. Imagine an individual who is struggling to
                provide for themselves, eventually however, they begin to
                thrive. They start a business and after having major success
                exit for a few million dollars. What is the standard look and
                lifestyle of this person after this event?
              </span>
              <span>
                For the most part, most people are living to keep their “social
                survival mammoth” feeling good. This is the part of the brain
                which feeds off of status, which defines our place in the social
                hierarchy. And this is not something I believe we can change,
                people WILL naturally compete to go up the chain of the social
                hierarchy, people want to outdo each other, people are
                competitive, people are different and respect should be given
                where it is due.
              </span>
              <span>
                This climb, this fight up the ladder is not inherently bad,
                what's wrong right now is what we consider to be markers of
                people who are higher up that ladder. We have been sold a
                narrative by the luxury and designer corporations, who have
                massive budgets to win the celebrities over, that designer and
                luxury clothing IS high status. Those who spend $4k on a
                designer bag versus one of equivalent quality for $50 are put
                higher on the status scale. If we can collectively redefine this
                status symbol as tacky, which has already been changing for
                in-your-face luxury design brand styles, we will change where
                the money which pays for status goes.
              </span>
              <span>
                While projects like Shelter NFT would build a home for a family
                who would have otherwise never had one before for the same price
                as a designer bag, it is no replacement for a BAG. People still
                want to buy a high end item, so instead, a brand which offers
                that price of bag, that level of quality, whose surplus funds
                goes towards making that positive change is perfect.

                If we have every individual with a self-interest approach we go
                into a terrible situation. The more we convert to love for
                others the better chance we have to pass the test.

                It wasn't until our culture defined cigarettes as bad that we
                quit them. They are just as addicting. They become negative
                status symbols. Hopefully showing the power status has on human
                behavior. If you thought sex/mating runs the world just wait
                till you realize that status is above even that.
