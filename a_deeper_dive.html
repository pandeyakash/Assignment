              <h2>A Deeper Dive</h2>
              <span
                >On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as
                in food, water, shelter. They can start to spend their time and
                money on convenience, health, and purpose but more often than
                not; status is where a majority of surplus wealth goes.
              </span>
              <span>
                Societally we lack an alignment of our status symbols with
                creating a better world and with bettering ourselves. This idea
                to change what we cultural see as status has been referred to as
                “Status Engineering”.
              </span>
              <span>
                What we wear is the most direct way we have to represent
                ourselves and our ideals/values. What your role model wears, or
                any person of influence is shaping the idea of status in that
                child, teenager, or adults mind.
              </span>
              <span>
                Status is what we are buying when we pay $1, $10, or even $500
                extra for a certain brand of T-Shirt irrespective of comfort.
              </span>
              <span>
                The problem is not that buying status is a failure mode of an
                individual. Status is a form of positive competitive drive in
                society and a tool for respect attribution. That’s why you see
                Dior shoes in economy. This is not a miscalculation, currently
                the status from spending $1100 on shoes does have more long term
                value than things like first class because we are playing the
                game of unenlightened capitalism.
              </span>
              <span>
                Once higher status objects are unveiled will these purely
                financial status seems become recognized for their tackiness and
                buying status will coincide with doing good. With no better
                alternative currently, we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on
                our highest display of who we are, the clothing we wear, we
                display 0 creativity or care for the world in spending and
                instead promote wasting wealth for the sake of power/leverage
                over others, and then we wonder why society is misaligned to
                building a healthy world. Fashion, what we wear, is the biggest
                signal we have in representing our identity and values.
              </span>
              <span>
                If we can provide a better representation of status in clothing
                we can not only change the money used to buy status into doing
                good for the world, but we can change our core representation of
                status in society towards doing good.
              </span>
              <span>
                While the larger belief is that this systemic change is the real
                impact in realigning our culture towards true status, the amount
                of funds in status spending that could be redirected towards
                positive causes is also no joke.

                Aligning status culturally on a global scale means reattributing
                that wealth towards benefit for humanity and shifting the entire
                global view of wealth.
